# Scrimba-React-Practice

I am currently learning React on two different platformds. SheCodes and Scrimba.
I initially started with SheCodes but found some of it quite confusing. I found the free course on the Scrimba platform and so far it has been quite easy to understand and follow along. This is where I practice React on scrimba.
Created with CodeSandbox
